# React Memory Game 


* **The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.** 

* **Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.**

* **Restart the game if the user guesses incorrectly. Set state to 0.**
